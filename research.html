    <strong>Payroll Tax Incidence at the Individual and Firm Level: Evidence from Spain</strong><br>
    [Draft available soon]
  </p>
  <p>
    This paper examines the incidence of employer-side payroll taxes through a reform in Spain that 
    introduced, and later repealed, a tax reduction for older workers on open-ended contracts and with 
    certain seniority at the firm. Using administrative Social Security data and matched employer-employee 
    records, I apply dynamic difference-in-differences models at both the individual and firm levels.
